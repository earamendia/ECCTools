# ECCTools

The `R` package `ECCTools` provides tools to modify and Energy Conversion Chain (ECC) that has been previously loaded using the `R` package `IEATools`. The `IEATools` package helps to load IEA data as well as to sort and prepare IEA data to formulate a Physical Supply Use Table (see @Heun:2018). However, the `IEATools` package treats imports as a supplying industry, and to this extent, adopts what we refer here to as the Free Imports Assumption: imports come for free, with no upstream associated conversion chain (and hence, no environmental burden and embodied energy).

The `ECCTools` package enables analysts to overcome this limitation through two different options:

1. The formulation of a Multi-Regional Physical Supply Use Table (MR-PSUT) framework representing the Energy Conversion Chain. In this case, imports are treated as supply coming from an industry located in a different region. This option is the most realistic one.
2. The formulation of a PSUT framework following the Domestic Technology Assumption (DTA). The DTA assumes that imports are produced within the region that imports them. Although the DTA is not a realistic assumption, it enables analysts to conduct useful simulations.


## Installation

You can install `ECCTools` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install devtools if not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earamendia/ECCTools")
# To build vignettes locally, use
devtools::install_github("earamendia/ECCTools", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## History

This package builds upon the previous `R` package `IEATools`, and has been first demonstrated in the paper @mr_psut_paper .
