ECCTools things to do:

First release - ready when sending the first version of MR-PSUT paper, to do while the MR-PSUT paper is under review by co-authors.
- Clean up package (split files etc)
- Write vignettes
	* Transform_to_dta
	* Transform_to_gma
- Do a first release
	* Needs to add the check_btd() function!
- Check that the codecov thing works

This can wait a bit as it is more related to the EROI work
- Write following functions:
	* aggregate_products()
	* split_elec_heat_chp_plants()
	* summarise_erois() + all helpers functions
